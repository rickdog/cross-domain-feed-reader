# cross-domain-feed-reader 

Stand-alone webpage that reads/displays RSS and ATOM feeds.
Uses YQL as a x-domain proxy and it's support for JSONP.
Also uses HTML5 template strings for brevity, but one can fork this and redo the templates or get a shim.
If the user enters a webpage instead, feeds are parsed out of the webpage and presented to the user to select.
